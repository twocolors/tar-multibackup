#### Example configuration

In the example below you can find a `multibackup` configuration file to backup a productional [LiveConfig](http://www.liveconfig.com/) instance.

`vi ~/.multibackup`

    # Timestamp format, used in the backup target filename
    timestamp=$(hostname)-$(date +%Y%m%d)

    # Destination where you want to store your backups
    backup_destination="/var/backups"

    # Folders/files to backup
    files_to_backup=(
      "/etc"
      "/var/mail"
      "/var/www"
      "/var/lib/mysql"
      "/var/spool/cron"
      "/var/lib/liveconfig"
    )

    # Files and folders that are excluded in the tar command
    tar_excludes=(
      "nginx-php-fcgi.sock"
    )

    # How long to you want to keep your backups (in days)
    backup_retention="+7"

    # Commands that are executed before the backup started
    # (We have to make sure the liveconfig process is not running)
    # (otherwise the databases changes while we try to save it)
    pre_commands=(
      "service liveconfig stop"
    )

    # Commands that are executed after the backup is completed
    # (To restart the liveconfig process again, once the backup is completed)
    post_commands=(
      "service liveconfig start"
    )

#### Cronjob setup

To make sure the backup is executed automatically and recurring, we're going to add a simple cronjob:

`vi /etc/cron.d/backup-liveconfig`

    #
    # cronjob to backup LiveConfig, daily at 5:00 am
    #

    0 5 * * *        root       /usr/local/bin/multibackup &>/dev/null
